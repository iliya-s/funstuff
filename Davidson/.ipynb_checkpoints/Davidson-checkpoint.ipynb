    "The Davidson algorithm is an efficent way to find a number of the lowest (or highest) valued eigenvalues of a large, diagonally dominant matrix. The general goal of the algorithm is to solve the eigenvalue problem for the matrix in question in a gradually growing subspace of orthonormal vectors and hope the eigenvector that corresponds to the lowest (or highest) valued eigenvalue exists in the span of this subspace. The main steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Guess an orthonormal basis of vectors with dimension greater than the number of eiegenvalues you are solving for\n",
    "   2. Calculate the residue vector and check for convergence. The residue vector is the vector left over after trying to solve the eiegenvalue problem with the guess vectors\n",
    "   3. Calculate the correction vector based on the residue vector and the approximate eigenvalue pairs\n",
    "   4. Add the correction vectors to your orthonormal subspace and repeat starting from step 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "The written function can be seen below.  "
